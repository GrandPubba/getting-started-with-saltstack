I've received some errata submissions, and would like to take the time to 
recognize those who made the effort to notify me of them.

If I only had a user name, I notate here. If the user provided me a full name
and gave permission to use it, I also notate it here.

These are my crowd-sourced editors and they took the time to point out mistakes.

If we ever meet in person, I would like to thank you and buy you your beverage
of choice!
